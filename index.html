            <p>Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, for the 
                sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle. By the 
                same illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the level of the 
                spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and 
                the car seemed to float in the middle of an immense dark sphere, whose 
                lf was strewn with silver. Looking down into the dark gulf below, 
                I could see a ruddy light streaming through a rift in the clouds.
